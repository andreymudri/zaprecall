## Introduction
Flashcards are cards that contain a question/statement on the front and an answer on the back. They can be used to train your memory using the Active Recall and Spaced Repetition methodologies. The idea is to read the question or statement and try to remember the answer. When encountering the same flashcard again, depending on the effort required to answer it, you become aware of which contents are fresh in your memory and which ones are not. This way, you can practice the contents that are not fresh frequently.

## "Zap!" Moment
When we instantly remember a flashcard, we had a "Zap!" moment âš¡. It signifies a successful recall and reinforces the memory.

## Decks
Sets of flashcards are called decks. This app should have at least one deck by default, consisting of 8 flashcards.

## Technologies used:
- React
- Styled Components
